Description: Allows users to input a dataset and from the distributions of the variables, they can sample
    and create a new dataset that is distributionally similar to the original. Users can sample in a univariate manner --
    every variable is independent, or allow for 2 variables to be associated and sample from that bivariate distribution.
    User is also able to get a list of all categorical variable pairs as well as continuous variable pairs. If they want
    the p-values between those pairs, that's possible too.
