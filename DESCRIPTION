Description: Allows users to input a dataset and sample from the distributions of the variables to create a new 
    dataset that is distributionally similar to the original. Users can sample in a univariate manner or allow
    2 variables to be associated and sample from that bivariate distribution.
    The user is also able to get a list of all categorical variable pairs as well as continuous variable pairs. 
    If they want the p-values between those pairs, that's possible too.
