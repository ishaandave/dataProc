### Takes census data and allows you to map racial distributions across the US (according to HHS boundaries)
### Will allow user to make a map whatever race/ethnicity they want to input

## eventually want to make it so, so we can create racial distributions across the 10 HHS divisions and use that
## to sample into our new dataset
